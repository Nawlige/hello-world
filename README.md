My Learrning Repository


This is my first Git Hub repository. 
I am a Business Systems Analyst and have done Data Analyst work proffesionally.

Over the last few years I have been undertaking an effort to expound on my personal IT skill set.
This has included gaining a deeper understaing of the 7 and 5 Layer Network Model, System Administration, Architecture and Security.
Programming with Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP.
